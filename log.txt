Start again.
First, preprocess the off-target data.
Discard the useless column.
Added colnames.
Figure out the ref_genome.
Original paper was based on GRCh37/hg19.
Wait for another test.
After 2 independent test, we can conclue that Original paper was based on GRC37.
I also generated sgRNA2seq csv.

Let us focus on classification first.
To focus on classification, we need to obtain records' genome coordinates.
To obtain the coordinates, we need to write a algorithm to mapping records to genome.
So, current task is to build this algorithm.
I created a notebook called genome_mapping.ipynb on colab to do this.

I noticed that toplevel hg19 is too big to process.
So I used primary level hg19 instead.
It's only 3GB.
I uploaded it to google drive.
I need to finished the mapping script as soon as possible.
I did it. Or, grok3 did it. No matters, it's a tool.
Next level: adjust input/output into tables.
